# Express.js CRUD Operations

### Description
This is a simple Express.js application that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using RESTful APIs. The application allows users to manage a collection of data items (e.g., users, products, etc.) by sending HTTP requests.

The CRUD operations are implemented using basic routes and are connected to a database (or an in-memory data structure in this case for simplicity). This project demonstrates how to handle typical CRUD operations for web applications using Express.js.

### Features
- **Create**: Allows creating new records in the database.
- **Read**: Allows retrieving records from the database.
- **Update**: Allows updating existing records.
- **Delete**: Allows deleting records from the database.
- **RESTful API**: Follows REST principles with HTTP methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

### Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment to run the application.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to create APIs and handle routing.
- **Body-parser**: Middleware to parse the incoming request bodies.
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose for object data modeling).
