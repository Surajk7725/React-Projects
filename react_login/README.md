# React Login Page with Express.js and MongoDB

### Description
This project demonstrates how to create a user login system using a **React** frontend, an **Express.js** backend, and **MongoDB** for storing user information. The application allows users to sign up with their credentials, which are then stored in a MongoDB database. Users can also log in with the credentials they provided.

### Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: React, Axios, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js, bcrypt (for password hashing)
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose for object data modeling)
- **Server**: Node.js

### Features:
- User Sign Up (creates a new user in the database)
- User Login (checks user credentials)
- Password Hashing (bcrypt for secure password storage)
- MongoDB (stores user information)
